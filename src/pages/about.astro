      <h1>A bit about me</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        I was born in Buffalo, but raised in Lake County, IL, and spent a lot of
        time traveling between the two growing up. I live in New York now, but I
        still carry memories of the midwest with me, primarily through my
        masochistic attachment to Chicago sports franchises.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied computer science at SUNY Binghamton, where I won a hackathon
        and conducted undergrad data science research for the CompSci and
        Psychology Departments. On the side, I was a DJ for the college radio
        station, WHRW 90.5 FM, where I ran "Pass the Aux", a music show with my
        friends, and "SoundSpeak", a talk show about new music releases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I work as a data analyst at CSEA, a labor union in New York,
        where I build data pipelines, visualize complex problems for leadership,
        and help modernize a legacy technical infrastructure. If you think I
        could be a benefit to your team, <a href="/cv">check out my CV</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I like to write about my experiences with art and
        technology, play basketball, and spend time with my partner of 6 years.
        I struggle with writing, even thought I've been doing it for a decade
        now, but nonetheless I wanted to build this site to finally have a
        public space for my thoughts. I hope you're able to take something
        insightful from it.
      </p>

        If you want to reach out to me - to talk shop about something I wrote,
        reach out about opportunities, or just introduce yourself - feel free to
        contact me directly at <u>haydenbrown at comcast dot net</u>! I'm always
        open to conversation and try to respond to every email I get.
