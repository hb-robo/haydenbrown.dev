A digital space to collect my writing, showcase my projects, and chronicle my professional journey.
Built with Astro.js.

### Why Astro?

1. Advanced boilerplating, making it easy to start fresh
2. Prebuilding support for static generation, to easily host on GitHub Pages
3. New content is as simple as the addition of a Markdown file with some metadata

## TODO:

- Add content tags for "in progress" articles
- Add dynamically calculated reading time as content metadata
- Add tags and content types to BlogPostPreview cards
- Implement blog index filter by tag/type
- Build out Projects page
- Implement dark mode
- Import content from all across my backlog
- Build out SEO mechanics
- Host on GitHub Pages
- Link hosted repo to custom domain
