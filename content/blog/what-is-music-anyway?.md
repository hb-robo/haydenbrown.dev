# reliving the death of rock

i've long held a belief that the evolution of rap is mirroring the evolution of rock music, with a ~30 year delay. it's an imperfect comparison, but as the two major sonic revolutions of the modern music recording era, they are otherwise mutually peerless in genre saturation. the sheer volume of listenership and creatives working within these frameworks, along with key technological advancements and stylistic shifts have caused similar growths and philosophical 

the most important throughline between rock and rap, however, was that sheer commerical dominance was so long that entire generations were born into the paradigm, and began to question it.

i was born in 1996, two weeks after the death of tupac shakur. by the time i was 5, eminem was the biggest american musician. at 10, he still was despite retirement. at 15, kanye west was. at 20 and 25, it was drake. today in 2025 we're seeing kendrick lamar's hostile takeover of the music industry. although i did my due diligence and delved into the history of rap, local scenes and their sounds, cult classics, and more, i was born into the paradigm, and therefore somewhat rejected it.

what every generation of a sound must cope with is that the next generation will forfeit their inheritance. it goes beyond the desire for something new, it's about ownership. the youth cannot merely carry torches, they must light one.

older millennials did a good job of rebelling against the x-er dominance of rap music, and for the most part they did so by making music lighter in tone. drake and kid cudi forged ground with melodic delivery. lil b spawned (among other things) cloud rap, famous for a sensory wall-of-sound approach intended to soothe and immerse the listener. the west coast had both the snap and jerk movements, and even the comparatively headier conscious revivalist movement (black hippy, blu & exile, u-n-i, etc.) had a sunny aesthetic quality. atlanta took over the world with high-energy trap music, whether it manifested with the joy of travis porter, the intensity of waka flocka, or the vulnerability of future's pluto era.

the late millennials had different plans. the abstraction of the genre continued, but darker and more indulgent. spaceghostpurrp and denzel curry forged a memphis rap revival that was drenched in lofi and murderous sounds. odd future emerged as a gang of shock jocks. travis scott's flood of voice modulation and melancholic, hazy production ushered in an era that romanticized drug use and the dissociative beauty of teetering on the edge of life and death. young thug (among others in atlanta, e.g. migos and rich homie quan) led a revolution in how emcees were evaluated by merging extreme technical ability and breath control with melodic precision and occasionally intentional unintelligibility. voices were an instrument, so both the timbre and tone weighed more heavily than the content of the speech itself.

in the modern day, we have come to grips with a lost generation in rap. the older zoomer generation lost almost all of their guiding light, with the loss of the three most generationally resonant artists - xxxtentacion, juice wrld, and pop smoke - echoing the unexpected deaths of kurt cobain, jeff buckley, and bradley nowell. between these losses and the otherwise historically turbulent early 2020s, they're still trying to find a sound. this power vacuum was almost entirely absorbed by drake, ultimately leading to his public execution in 2024. but even before kendrick lamar's usurpation, drake posed the same problem to the kids that eminem and kanye did to me: it's not theirs. the music is not made from their perspective, it just caters to it. ultimately, this dissonance can't stand.

# enter: the vamp

enter playboi carti, our unlikely protagonist. he is the youngest of his generation and the same age as me. 

taking the new age vocal delivery to its logical conclusion. his earlier work was so anti-lyrical that some songs were entirely performed as strings of adlibs or vocal sound effects.



# historical justice / forcing a fashion statement

frequently takes stylistic cues from beloved, yet often-misunderstood or hated southern rap styles, things lambasted as undereducated (short bus shawty) or shallow

the mere act of acknowledgement is validation. it was history regardless
- the epicenter of this was Carti's hometown, atlanta georgia
- I followed the scene with close intensity, but from a distance (and privately), and my lack of proximity caused some confusion
    - admitted misunderstanding of the merits of proto-trap
    - I remember an exchange with Tyler, the Creator in his tumblr days, he had a Formspring account and I asked him how it felt to already be technically superior than some of his influences (ferrari boys, not clipse/neptunes). he did not take it well
    - it took adoption by major artists for me to fully understand the significance
        - don't like remix was the watershed moment
        - Magna Carta Holy Grail by jay z
        - yeezus by kanye west, specifically the TNGHT interpolations of trap electronica
    - later, my friends and I started to ironically, then unironically love the sound
        - Flockaveli by Waka Flocka
        - Monster and SGB: The Movie by Future
        - Back From the Dead and Almighty So, especially with 
    - weirder kids like me followed the rabbit hole to spaceghostpurrp, lil ugly mane, and the whole memphis revivalist movement happening in florida via raider klan

- people who are precisely our age saw the eventual commodification of the snap, jerk, and trap sounds assimilate into mainstream pop rap, but the form drastically changed in 2015, making the early 10s a uniquely bright/boistrous era before the darkness that followed
- there is an infamous quote about how the 00s was dominated by rappers that sold drugs, but the 2010s was dominated by rappers that abused drugs... a natural and inevitable cycle
- that early 2010s period served as a kind of transitional period, where party rap skyrocketed in popularity and 

Like Weezy - sampling Travis Porter-esque party rap song, pays homage in the video intro
(insert picture of song title card)
- mus also acknowledge Wayne as the undisputed GOAT of this era, especially in the Southern US

it's amazing to see marquee 2020s producers completely commit to this bit
- Metro on RADAR - the hottest producer of the last decade
- Cardo on CRANK

structurally resembles a DatPiff era mixtape, 30 songs in length, complete with a very audible DJ, and songs completely performed by the lead artist's friends as a form of cross promotion, but carrying a fashionablility that is very modern, like the mixtape was being "worn" by a tastemaker, transforming it into an aesthetic statement.
- to say carti is influential in the fashion world is an understatement

feels more authentic and respectful than mere parading, fully dives into the sound and explores its corners, similar to how y2k was explored and expanded upon 
- simultaneously, the distance from that sound forms it into a weapon of sorts, to be deployed and smacked into your face, 
- it explore the viability of some of these sounds in a completely different era of music, rap music, and rap music listenership

for a while, I was kind of worried that sampling in hip-hop was going to run out of usable material. surely rap can't sample itself without creating a feedback loop, no? sampling "wat's wrong" still necessitates an incidental sampling of stanley cowell by inheritance. besides getting progressively harder to work with, it also seems to open up debilitating levels of accumulated royalties that could prevent commercial release entirely. what i failed to consider was the whole world of self-constructed 

the fact that we're fully into an era of reinterpolating trap choruses and 808 beats into the same ethereal mirrors as we do ronald isley continues to amaze me.

(insert )

i suppose this begs the question of the creative message behind, for example, sampling and interpolating a 2011 song by an artist that intentionally made music that resembled projects from 1992-1994 made by memphis residents who had almost no equipment to work with, no marketing budget, .

each echo reverberates louder, but becomes more detached from the source. it can be argued that the current fashionability of these sounds from one of the ~5 most popular rappers in the world, a decimillionaire obsessed with image taking cues from decades of music made by people in poverty trying to make a better life gives a confused impression. on one hand, the gift of exposure is powerful, on the other, it's sort of vampiric. we have the luxury of sifting through the literal hundreds of thousands of freely available, non-commercial mixtapes for bits to use for our own gain, but those artists lived and died trying to make their sound work in their era. they competed for a spot, and almost everyone didn't get one. by comparison, retrospective curation doesn't carry any risk, but has more to gain. 

i can't be too hard on carti, though. we are the same age, and although we experienced this musical world in very different contexts, the memories are there. if nothing else, perhaps carti is cultivating affection for the attitude and approach. truly, who can say carti has played ANYTHING safe in his long career? MUSIC opens by putting a dentist drill directly into your eardrums. he may have a safety net, but there is always the risk of losing what you built, and carti unabashedly pushes his own sound forward with every project.

# a question of leadership

the sheer intrigue of this sound makes more commercial tracks stick out and feel misplaced, even when they're perfectly serviceable or even good.

# who deserves empathy?

the y2k revivalist movement didn't hit me all that hard because I was too young to really understand what it was really like in the moment. I only have memories of magazine ads, the radio, the backs of DVD cases, and other peripheral perspectives of that beating heart. I was still a child, not yet "living" the era, just observing it between more localized memories of my school and neighborhood.

the culture of the time doesn't affect a child that profoundly because they don't know anything else. living long enough to notice and embrace change is another story, though. in the prime of the datpiff era, I was 13 years old and tasting my first bit of real personal agency. we were all more online than our parents, and through that i learned so much about what the world was doing and sharing, giving me greater perspective on what was new and innovative.

it might seem fairly alien to the modern consumer but the vast majority of music in rap released in my teen years was done so for completely free.

mixtapes went diamond off of a download button.

this approach required a degree of effort from the user. sure, you'd hear about stuff from friends or feeds or social media, but mostly from other artists on features. when people got signed to major deals many listeners already knew who they were. it was like finally getting access to college basketball after years of only seeing the nba. the determination and skill required to find a pocket and ride it into legitimate success was on display for all to see. artists competed day in, day out to make it, and we all watched in real time.

social media was in its toddler years, and I would argue this is the last vestige of centralized musical culture before artists' personal feeds created unprecedented access to artists. out of the blog aggregator era, the artists became blogs unto themselves. you didn't need datpiff, you needed the tumblr or twitter or instagram page of your favorite musicians to let you know when stuff was download or buy.

to see an era I understood so intimately and spent so much of my time exploring and understanding finally be reupholstered in the same way as fruitger aero has touched a nerve. for one, I'm old. the world is unrecognizable compared to my recollections of Obama-era optimism. for two, I am starting to recognize the extent to which revivalism deconstructs.

*MUSIC* isn't a complete recreation of the era, it's a curated assembly of contemporary traits. Snapback culture isn't back, nobody is hitting the spongebob in ultra slim jeans, and the cologned sheen over pop music is very much still a relic. Stoner purism culture naivety is still a memory. No, the album is a trip down memories of this era, interwoven with the drug-laden, chopped and screwed and reinterpreted in the comparative nightmare dimension that is 2025.

ultimately, despite not complying strictly to the norms of the era, MUSIC displays an intimate understanding of what it was like to be there without pretending it can truly be recreated.

taking in as a whole, the most depressed moments on MUSIC tend to be the most bleeding-edge, and ultimately they dominate the sonic tendency. but the brightest and most carefree moments on the project sound the most nostalgic. i guess even millionaires have spent the 2020s dreaming of the past.
