# a journey down 

# enter: the vamp

# historical justice

frequently takes stylistic cues from beloved, yet often-misunderstood or hated southern rap styles, things lambasted as undereducated (short bus shawty) or shallow

the mere act of acknowledgement is validation. it was history regardless

Like Weezy - sampling Travis Porter-esque party rap song, pays homage in the video intro
(insert picture of song title card)
- mus also acknowledge Wayne as the undisputed GOAT of this era, especially in the Southern US

it's amazing to see marquee 2020s producers completely commit to this bit
- Metro on RADAR - the hottest producer of the last decade
- Cardo on CRANK

structurally resembles a DatPiff era mixtape, 30 songs in length, complete with a very audible DJ, and songs completely performed by the lead artist's friends as a form of cross promotion, but carrying a fashionablility that is very modern, like the mixtape was being "worn" by a tastemaker, transforming it into an aesthetic statement.

feels more authentic and respectful than mere parading, fully dives into the sound and explores its corners, similar to how y2k was explored and expanded upon 

the sheer intrigue of this sound makes more commercial tracks stick out and feel misplaced, even when they're perfectly serviceable or even good.


# who deserves restorative justice?
