## Expression through possession

To christen this new blog, I'm pleased to announce a series of essays exploring the physical media I’ve chosen to keep— albums, games, books, films, and more. Each entry will dive into why these items made the cut, what sets them apart, and why they’ve earned a permanent spot in my collection. In a digital, immaterial world, these works remind me of the value in owning something tangible and lasting.

My early goal with the project is to not be too exclusionary. The artworks you'll see in this series are ones I feel strongly positive about, but to put a number on it, the list correlates to 7/10s and up. Considering the steep bell curve that I tend to produce when criticizing in volume, that comes out to ≥1 standard deviation above average, or the top ~15% of the art I experience.

In some abstract, shibuya-kei-like sense, my hope is this series helps to explain and clarify my tastes, biases, and critical voice by the throughlines and subtext binding this collection. A constellation of loosely related objects of affection may even communicate such things than direct explanation. In isolation, I can misrepresent myself. In aggregate, I hope to be seen more truly.

## Capcom-gate, or the idea of Capcom-gate

Last January, Capcom went to war with modders for their active online Steam titles after an official _Street Fighter 6_ tournament in Europe accidentally broadcasted gameplay with an X-rated custom Chun-Li skin. It resulted in a number of their marquee multiplayer titles being hit with shady DRM that temporarily broke compatibility with Proton, caused performance issues, and generally annoyed everyone. Protecting the integrity of competition is ultimately respectable, and that was the primary concern addressed. More concerning was the revelation that they had been quietly inserting DRM into older single-player titles for around a year and a half.

The scope of the DRM rollout was initially overestimated, and the news cycle around it was a rampage. I admit to being emotionally manipulated by reactionary reporting, because like many others, I was angry. Even if the technical issues were resolved within a couple of days, I felt like Capcom had violated a fundamental assumption underpinning the sale of software. When I bought the games, they didn't have DRM. They worked on Linux without the need for Proton updates, and they weren't losing performance to software that could be doing anything shy of kernel access on my PC. Suddenly, without the ability to opt-out or contest it, my existing collection was afflicted. The terms of play changed after the money had been taken.

"Capcomgate", for all the restlessness it brought me, helped me clarify a discomfort with digital media. What felt like a violation 

The situation catalyzed the cognitive dissonance I'd been carrying about Steam as a platform.


I still admire Steam, and to a greater extent, Valve. Part of that could be 14 years of Stockholm syndrome, but I find them to be a refreshing mainstay amidst a gaming industry in a tailspin. The Steam Deck is an amazing piece of hardware, and probably my most beloved purchase of the 2020s. If a game is exclusively released digitally, I will undoubtedly play on it on Steam over any console for the versatility of swapping between different hardware form factors with cloud saves. When I inevitably enter the VR space, it will probably be through the upcoming Deckard project. Still, I can't live an ecosystem full-time when purchases are just licenses.


For years, I harvested mountains of digital games, rarely ever spending more than $20 USD for one, and the vast majority coming under $5. I was addicted to bundles and "deals", despite only ever touching around 20% of my library. It's probably fair to say that I accumulated more games than I could play in a lifetime. It was wasteful, and worse, my enthusiasm waned as the collection grew. Seeing the waste every time you look for something to play is deflating.


What followed was nothing less than a full-blown emotional crisis as I battled feelings of remorse for over-indexing into an ecosystem that was liable to collapse under my feet at any time. I purchased those games under a pretense that they would function correctly without issues, and that pretense hadn't been challenged until then.

## Enter: the shelf

## Having stuff isn't really practical

## 

## Setting healthy writing boundaries

Pragmatically, this series also thaws a couple of my barriers to writing consistently. I've been critiquing art for my entire adult life, starting on RateYourMusic.com in 2014, hosting the radio talk show "SoundSpeak" in college to review albums alongside a panel, and writing about games on Glitchwave and Backloggd the last 5 years. All in all, I've written or talked about a thousand different pieces of art over the last decade, not including casual conversations.

What people might not know is that this isn't through a strong will to hone my criticism skills, or an ego driven to share opinions, but of a compulsive inability to stop. The "critical eye" - a learning one, especially - becomes a laser beam that makes casual enjoyment of things very difficult. For stages of my journey, I struggled with ironic or comedic appreciation of things, especially in group settings. I lost the ability to listen to music passively while working or ignore conversations without eavesdropping due to an overeager ear taught to process details.

There is also a guilt that forms when you don't fully understand or digest some piece of art and move on with your life without an evaluatory process.

and have seen a lot of reactions to my work. The same few core ideas regularly resurface, whether I'm sharing my thoughts with others or vice a versa. 

#### 1. Not everybody needs to join every conversation.

This is a personal pet peeve of mine, and while I see others echo it, I feel the message is misinterpreted. Often this is code for the polite idiom of "if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all," but this is an unserious idea when it comes to art. Evaluation can't just be based on the volume of positive reception alone, lest it resemble a consumer economy, designed to offend the fewest people in the least expensive manner possible. 

#### 2. Almost everything is unremarkable

####

3. 


Negative reviews are a delicate matter

No pressure to talk about everything I consume lessens the feeling that writing is a burden.

When I do talk about things that didn't make the shelf, I can focus on "interesting" failures.
