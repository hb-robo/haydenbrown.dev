## Expression through possession

To christen this new blog, I'm pleased to announce a series of essays exploring the physical media I’ve chosen to keep— albums, games, books, films, and more. Each entry will dive into why these items made the cut, what sets them apart, and why they’ve earned a permanent spot in my collection. In a digital, immaterial world, these works remind me of the value in owning something tangible and lasting.

My early goal with the project is to not be too exclusionary. The artworks you'll see in this series are ones I feel strongly positive about, but to put a number on it, the list correlates to 7/10s and up. Considering the steep bell curve that I tend to produce when criticizing in volume, that comes out to ≥1 standard deviation above average, or the top ~15% of the art I experience.

In some abstract, shibuya-kei-like sense, my hope is this series helps to explain and clarify my tastes, biases, and critical voice by the throughlines and subtext binding this collection. A constellation of loosely related objects of affection may even communicate such things than direct explanation. In isolation, I can misrepresent myself. In aggregate, I hope to be seen more truly.

## Capcom-gate, or the idea of Capcom-gate

Last January, Capcom went to war with modders for their active online Steam titles after an official _Street Fighter 6_ tournament in Europe accidentally broadcasted gameplay with an X-rated custom Chun-Li skin. It resulted in a number of their marquee multiplayer titles being hit with shady DRM that temporarily broke compatibility with Proton, caused performance issues, and generally annoyed everyone. Protecting the integrity of competition is ultimately respectable, and that was the primary concern addressed. More concerning was the revelation that they had been quietly inserting DRM into older single-player titles for around a year and a half.

The scope of the DRM rollout was initially overestimated, and the news cycle around it was a rampage. I admit to being emotionally manipulated by reactionary reporting, because like many others, I was angry. Even if the technical issues were resolved within a couple of days, I felt like Capcom had violated a fundamental assumption underpinning the sale of software. When I bought the games, they didn't have DRM. They worked on Linux without the need for Proton updates, and they weren't losing performance to software that could be doing anything shy of kernel access on my PC. Suddenly, without the ability to opt-out or contest it, my existing collection was afflicted. The terms of play changed after the money had been taken.

"Capcomgate", for all the restlessness it brought me, helped me clarify a discomfort with digital media. What felt like a violation 

The situation catalyzed the cognitive dissonance I'd been carrying about Steam as a platform.


I still admire Steam, and to a greater extent, Valve. Part of that could be 14 years of Stockholm syndrome, but I find them to be a refreshing mainstay amidst a gaming industry in a tailspin. The Steam Deck is an amazing piece of hardware, and probably my most beloved purchase of the 2020s. If a game is exclusively released digitally, I will undoubtedly play on it on Steam over any console for the versatility of swapping between different hardware form factors with cloud saves. When I inevitably enter the VR space, it will probably be through the upcoming Deckard project. Still, I can't live an ecosystem full-time when purchases are just licenses.


For years, I harvested mountains of digital games, rarely ever spending more than $20 USD for one, and the vast majority coming under $5. I was addicted to bundles and "deals", despite only ever touching around 20% of my library. It's probably fair to say that I accumulated more games than I could play in a lifetime. It was wasteful, and worse, my enthusiasm waned as the collection grew. Seeing the waste every time you look for something to play is deflating.


What followed was nothing less than a full-blown emotional crisis as I battled feelings of remorse for over-indexing into an ecosystem that was liable to collapse under my feet at any time. I purchased those games under a pretense that they would function correctly without issues, and that pretense hadn't been challenged until then.

## Enter: the shelf

## Having stuff isn't really practical

## 

## Naturally healthy writing boundaries

The boundaries of engagement naturally set by this essay series also thaw a couple of my barriers to writing consistently.

I've been critiquing art for my entire adult life, starting on RateYourMusic.com in 2014 (still continuing today), hosting the radio panel talk show "SoundSpeak" in college to review albums, and writing about games on Glitchwave and Backloggd and private journals over the last 5 years. All in all, I've written or formally discussed around a thousand different pieces of art over the last decade, not including casual conversations. What might not be clear, however, is this volume isn't caused by a strong will to hone my writing skills, or an ego driven to share opinions, but a compulsive inability to stop.

The "critical eye" - a learning one, especially - becomes a laser beam that makes casual enjoyment of things very difficult. For stages of my journey, I struggled with ironic or comedic appreciation of things, especially in group settings. The ears I conditioned to be detail-oriented and overeager caused me to lose the ability to listen to music passively while working, or to ignore conversations without eavesdropping. Eventually, the pattern recognition from processing so much can destroy suspension of disbelief, or the ability to truly judge things in isolation, apart from the broader context of its creation.

There is also a guilt that forms when you don't fully understand or digest some piece of art and move on with your life without an evaluatory process. It's the same guilt you feel skipping a day at the gym, or ignoring a text. You only see nails if you identify as a hammer, but to write about something is an effort. If you consume as much as the average American person per month, you're looking at 80 hours of music, 1 book, 15 hours of gaming, 90 hours of streamed film/TV, and maybe a movie at the theaters. Writers tend to be enthusiasts, and so have to juggle their time between the consumption and the processing. Unless you're paid for it, I'd say most people don't have the bandwidth to write something worth reading about *everything*. My pet theory is that this is the reason for the hyper-succinct, comedic review style popularized on Letterboxd.

Being overly methodical costs you freedom, time, and stress. My fellow critics-in-recovery may also find they must practice the permission to let experiences pass you by without serious mental exercise. Part of the elegance of The Shelf is that definitionally, everything that is talked about must be worth talking about. Love is proximate to familiarity.


#### 2. Almost everything is unremarkable

This calls back to the bell curve concept. Assuming that a true random selection of art experiences will create a normal distribution of responses within a person (which is verifiably true for myself, at least), then roughly 68% of everything you experience is firmly *mid*, or within 1 standard deviation in either direction. I've personally found that even when mandating 100 words minimum for a microreview, there were still some things I couldn't bring myself to discuss.

Mediocrity can be interesting to digest for the practice of parsing good and bad, weighing it and deciding what is pivotal to your experience of the work, but most of the middle ground isn't a rollercoaster of quality, it's a dull, murmuring hum that inspires nothing.For this reason, Made the Shelf naturally avoids the tedium of completeness.

3. 


Negative reviews are a delicate matter

No pressure to talk about everything I consume lessens the feeling that writing is a burden.

When I do talk about things that didn't make the shelf, I can focus on "interesting" failures.
